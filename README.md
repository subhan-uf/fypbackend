# FYPBackend – Comprehensive Scheduling System Backend

## Overview

**FYPBackend** is the robust backend powering the advanced academic scheduling platform currently implemented at NED University of Engineering and Technology and used across multiple departments. It exposes a rich set of RESTful APIs for managing users, batches, courses, rooms, preferences, compensatory classes, timetable generations, and more, serving as the data and business logic layer for the [FYPFinal frontend](https://github.com/subhan-uf/fypfinal).

---

## Architecture

- **Framework:** Django + Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (configurable via environment variables)
- **Auth:** JWT (SimpleJWT), session, and basic authentication support
- **Modular Apps:** Advisors, Users, Scheduler, etc.
- **Admin Interface:** Django admin for direct data management

---

## Major Features & Modules

### User & Role Management

- **DEOs, Advisors, Chairman, Teachers:** CRUD endpoints for all staff roles
- **Authentication:** Secure login/logout for DEOs and Advisors
- **Department & Faculty Management:** Manage academic departments and faculties

### Batch, Section, Course, Room Management

- **Batches/Sections:** Create, update, delete, and query batches and their sections
- **Courses:** Full course lifecycle management, discipline association
- **Rooms:** Manage rooms (labs, lecture halls), capacity, type, and status

### Assignment & Preferences

- **Teacher-Course Assignment:** Assign teachers to courses and batches
- **Batch-Course-Teacher Assignment:** Complex links between batches, courses, and teachers
- **Preferences & Constraints:** Define course time constraints, room preferences, teacher-room assignments

### Timetable Generation & Management

- **Timetable Generation:** Endpoints for generating, retrieving, and managing timetable headers and details (see note below)
- **Compensatory Classes:** Manage compensatory sessions, overlay them on regular timetables
- **Status Tracking:** Published, pending, and historical generations

### Reports & Data Export

- **Timetable Reports:** Downloadable PDF reports of generated timetables for documentation and sharing

### API Explorer & Documentation

- **Browsable API:** Interactive API explorer via DRF, with authentication controls (token, basic, session)
- **Well-documented Endpoints:** Each major entity (user, batch, course, room, preference, generation) exposes comprehensive CRUD operations

## Core Business Logic

### Smart Timetable Generation

The heart of the backend is its **extremely comprehensive, custom timetable generation algorithm**. This logic ensures:
- Timetables are generated for batches, teachers, and rooms while respecting a myriad of constraints and preferences.
- Handles edge cases, tight room/time/teacher constraints, compensatory sessions, and dynamic status updates.
- Capable of producing optimal schedules even in highly restrictive scenarios.

> **Note:**  
> The actual timetable generation algorithm is **not public** due to its proprietary and custom nature. This keeps the intellectual property of the solution protected and ensures that the unique scheduling logic remains exclusive to NED University.

## Integration with Frontend

- Designed to work seamlessly with [FYPFinal](https://github.com/subhan-uf/fypfinal)
- All business logic, data validation, and scheduling computation are handled here; frontend is a visualization and interaction layer
